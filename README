AssayJava contains code you can use to perform "assays" of data sets from databases
or flat files or other data sources to help you understand the variability of the
data.

I have used this to validate what people told me about what was *supposedly* in the
data set they were going to have me depend on. I would get the data file from them
and run this and then ask them all the follow up questions like "wait, what does
it mean when the order_date field contains the text 'X' instead of a date?".
